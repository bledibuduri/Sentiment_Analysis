# Sentiment Analysis Project

## Overview

This project focuses on performing sentiment analysis using various machine learning classifiers. The primary goal is to analyze textual data and classify sentiments as positive, negative, or neutral. The project utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to achieve this.

## Features

- **Text Representation**: The project implements two methods for text representation:
  - **TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)**: A statistical measure that evaluates the importance of a word in a document relative to a collection of documents.
  - **Bag-of-Words**: A simple representation of text data where each unique word is represented as a feature.

- **Stopwords Handling**: The project allows the option to include or exclude stopwords (common words that may not contribute significantly to sentiment analysis).

- **Classifiers**: The following classifiers are implemented:
  - Logistic Regression
  - Linear Support Vector Classifier (SVC)
  - Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) Classifier
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - XGBoost Classifier

## Requirements

To run this project, you need to have the following libraries installed:

- `nltk`
- `pandas`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `xgboost`

You can install these libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install nltk pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn xgboost
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentiment-analysis.git
   cd sentiment-analysis
   ```

2. Download the necessary NLTK resources:

   ```python
   import nltk
   nltk.download('stopwords')
   ```

3. Run the sentiment analysis experiments:

   The main function to run experiments is `train_experiments()`. You can specify the feature representation, stopwords option, and classifier you want to use. For example:

   ```python
   features = ["tf-idf", "bag-of-words"]
   stopwords = [True, False]
   classifiers = [LogisticRegression(), LinearSVC(), SGDClassifier(), MultinomialNB(alpha=0.01), XGBClassifier()]
   train_experiments(feature=features[0], stopwords=stopwords[0], classifier=classifiers[2])
   ```

## Results

The results of the sentiment analysis experiments will include accuracy scores and visualizations of the classifier performances. You can use Seaborn and Matplotlib to create various plots to analyze the results further.
